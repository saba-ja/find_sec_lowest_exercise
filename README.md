## Find Second Lowest Value

The objective of this exercise is to write a module to find the second lowest
number in an stream of 16 bit values. The valid signal must be asserted to
indicate valid input. There is a 2 clock cycle latency in the output of the
module. The captured values can be cleared via active low rest of the module.

To run the testbench in Questasim navigate to the sim folder then
in the command line run the following:

```
vsim -do ./run.do
```

If already in Questasim from the TCL console run the following:

```
source ./run.do
```
